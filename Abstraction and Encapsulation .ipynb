    "##### Q1. What is Abstraction in OOps? Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans - Abstraction is a concept in OOPs that helps to ahndle complexity by hiding unnecessary details from the user. It allows th euser to implement more complex logic without understanding all the hidden complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two types of abstraction :\n",
    "\n",
    "Data Abstraction -It hides th edetails of data entities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Process Abstraction - It hides the underlying implementation of a process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of abstraction is making coffee with a coffee machine. we need to know how to use your coffee machine to make coffee. You need to provide water and coffee beans, switch it on and select the kind of coffee you want to get. The thing we donâ€™t need to know is how the coffee machine is working internally to brew a fresh cup of coffee."
